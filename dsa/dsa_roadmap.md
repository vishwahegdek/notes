# üõ§Ô∏è Java DSA Roadmap

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Foundations: Get Comfortable with Java Basics
* Data types, Variables, Operators
* Conditionals, Loops
* Functions/Methods
* OOP concepts: Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Strings (Basic to Intermediate)
* Basic operations: length, charAt, substring, compareTo, equals
* StringBuilder & StringBuffer (mutability, performance)
* Common problems:
   * Reverse a string
   * Check palindrome
   * Count vowels/consonants
   * Anagram check (use HashMap)
   * Substring problems (sliding window intro)

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Arrays (1D & 2D)
* Basic operations: insert, delete, traverse
* Common problems:
   * Find max/min
   * Reverse an array
   * Rotate array (using extra space & in-place)
   * Kadane's Algorithm (Maximum subarray sum)
   * Two-pointer problems
* **2D Arrays:**
   * Matrix traversal
   * Spiral traversal
   * Transpose & Rotate matrix

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Searching Algorithms
* Linear search
* Binary search (on sorted arrays)
* Applications:
   * Search insert position
   * First & last occurrence
   * Number of occurrences
   * Square root of a number (binary search)

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Sorting Algorithms
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
* Built-in Java Arrays.sort() and Collections.sort()

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Hashing & HashMaps
* Introduction to HashMap, HashSet
* Frequency count problems
* Two Sum
* Subarray with 0 sum
* Longest consecutive subsequence
* Count distinct elements

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Sliding Window & Two-pointer Techniques
* Maximum sum subarray of size k
* Smallest window containing substring
* Longest substring with k distinct characters

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Linked Lists
* Singly linked list: insert, delete, reverse
* Detect cycle (Floyd's)
* Merge two sorted lists
* Middle of the linked list
* Doubly linked list basics

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Stacks & Queues
* Stack using array & linked list
* Infix to postfix
* Valid parentheses
* Queue using array & linked list
* Circular Queue
* Deque basics

## üîü Trees & Binary Trees
* Tree terminology & creation
* Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder (recursive & iterative)
* Height, diameter of binary tree
* Mirror tree
* Binary Search Tree:
   * Search, insert, delete
   * Floor & ceil
   * Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

## üî¢ Recursion & Backtracking (Parallel Track)
* Basic recursion (factorial, fibonacci)
* Subset sum, permutations, combinations
* N-Queens
* Sudoku solver

## üîó Graphs (later phase)
* Representation: Adjacency Matrix/List
* BFS & DFS
* Cycle detection (undirected & directed)
* Topological sort

## ‚úÖ Practice Approach
* Use **LeetCode**, **GFG (GeeksforGeeks)**, and **HackerRank**
* Try to implement **everything from scratch** in Java first
* Maintain a GitHub repo to track your progress (boosts portfolio too!)
